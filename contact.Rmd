# How to get in touch with me:

**Professional Methods:** See the 'CV' section to look at my resume and find the established professional methods of contact

**Less Profressional Methods:** For unprofessional methods, I will remember you favorably if you send me food or maybe buy me a book? We could also play Rocket League together! I don't know, my girlfriend says I shouldn't even have an 'Unprofesssional Methods' section in my website.
