# Shiny: PCA and Databases with Pokemon

I spent much of my time at PNC Bank building web apps using R Shiny. Many of them involve PII data and are thus lost to the public. One application is alive and well for public consumption, however. That application is about Databases and Pokemon.

View it in full screen [here](https://marshallp.shinyapps.io/pokeshiny/){target="_blank"} (it's better)

Don't forget to submit your favorite Pokemon!

```{r PokemonApp, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.width=13}
knitr::include_url(
  "https://marshallp.shinyapps.io/pokeshiny/",
  height = '900px'
  )
```
